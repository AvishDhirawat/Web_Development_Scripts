# Web_Development_Scripts
The repository contains some of my work and examples on web development using HTML, CSS, JavaScript and PHP
To run your php script first you need to install XAMPP then you have to navigate through htdocs folder in XAMPP directory and paste your script there then run the file from your browser as localhost/file_name.extension
It will work!
